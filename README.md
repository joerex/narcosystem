The NARCOSYSTEM
===============

Narcissus, narcosis, numbness. The NARCOSYSTEM is a multimedia installation that addresses the cultural changes of digital self-documentation and social exhibition â€“ in essence, the NARCOSYSTEM is an exploration of digital vanity and a looking glass into the emergence of a new collective subconscious identity. The subversive effects of Youtube, Instagram, and other online self-publishing platforms have created a system of culture that fortifies singular nodes out of individuals, actively connecting and weaving together patterns of association to catalyze a reversal from singular to mass identity.
